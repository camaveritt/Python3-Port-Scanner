# Port-Scanner 🌐

This is a fully functional port scanner project made with Python3.  The `get_open_ports` function can be called with `target` (IP or hostname) and `port_range` arguments and will return any open ports within the range.  Also includes an optional verbose functionality which will return more detailed information.
